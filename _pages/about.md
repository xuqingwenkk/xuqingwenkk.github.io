I joined Tongji University as a PostDoc at the lab of Prof. [Tong Xiaohua](https://celiang.tongji.edu.cn/index.php?classid=5786&t=show&id=13). I received my bachelor degree with Information Engineering from Southeast University in June, 2015. Then I got PhD degree at ShanghaiTech University & China Academic of Science in July, 2021. 

My research interests include visual slam, omnidirectional vision and mobile robots. Now I am working on space robotics. Interesting work will be shared. If you want to know more about my previous work, you can find my publications on google scholar.


Here is my complete [CV](http://xuqingwenkk.github.io/files/CV_xuqw.pdf).
